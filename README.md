# Getting Started with Project

This project includes a frontend built with React and utility scripts written in JavaScript for Node.js.

## Available Commands

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Installs all the dependencies listed in `package.json`.\
This is required before running or building the project.

### `npm start`

Runs the React app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload automatically when you make changes.\
You may also see lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for best performance.

### `node filename.js`

Executes a standalone JavaScript file using Node.js.\
Replace `filename.js` with your actual script filename.\
Useful for running server-side scripts or utilities that support the frontend.
